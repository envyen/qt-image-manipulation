*Computer Vision course - [Politecnico di Torino](http://www.polito.it) - academic year 2012-2013*

A project, made in Qt Creator and using OpenCV 2.4.3, for grubbing a video from the webcam and manipulate its frame: add a logo in the corner of the video player, convert the video in grayscale, and save the result on disk.

Before using such a projecta, you must open its `.pro` files and edit the path to the OpenCV library, which should be already installed on your computer.
